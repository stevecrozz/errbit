<p>There are any number of ways to deploy Errbit, but official support is limited
to heroku and capistrano.</p>

<p>See specific notes on deployment via:
- <a href="deployment/heroku.md">heroku</a>
- <a href="deployment/dokku.md">dokku</a>
- <a href="deployment/capistrano.md">capistrano</a>
- <a href="deployment/docker.md">docker</a>
- <a href="deployment/kubernetes.md">kubernetes (experimental)</a></p>

<p>You can use a process manager to deploy Errbit, but Errbit doesnâ€™t maintain
support for any specific process manager. But if you use systemd, @nofxx has
been kind enough to share:
